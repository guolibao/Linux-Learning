Compiling in Debian
-------------------

In order to build examples for current prebuilt kernel, you should install 
linux-headers package for you current kernel:

$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

You will also need make tools:

$ sudo apt-get install make

Now just run make in example dir you want to build.

NOTE: These examples were designed for latest linux kernel and you might not 
be able to build some of them for older prebuilt kernels from Debian-based 
distributives.
