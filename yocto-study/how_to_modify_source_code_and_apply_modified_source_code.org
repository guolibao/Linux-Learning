The package's source located 
=${TMPDIR}/work/${MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS}/${PN}/${EXTENDPE}${PV}-${PR}/git= or unpacked directory name

For example,

=tmp/work/cortexa9-vfp-neon-telechips-linux-gnueabi/tc-launcher/1.0.0-r0/git=

=tmp/work/cortexa9-vfp-neon-telechips-linux-gnueabi/alsa-lib/1.0.28-r0/alsa-lib-1.0.28/=
