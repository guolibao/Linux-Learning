* building instruction

** when building

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
bitbake -c fetch mscsend
#+END_SRC

this will fetch the mscsend.c file from git server and put it to
dowloads directory.

as in =local.conf=
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
DL_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/downloads"
#+END_SRC

many path variables is defined in =meta/conf/bitbake.conf=

if you want to see the files in the ${B}, defined in =meta/conf/bitbake.conf=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
WORKDIR = "${BASE_WORKDIR}/${MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS}/${PN}/${EXTENDPE}${PV}-${PR}"
S = "${WORKDIR}/${BP}"
B = ${S}
#+END_SRC

you need to run :

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
bitbake -c unpack mscsend
#+END_SRC


for the local file that is in yocto, (for example, patch file, some config file, etc)
that is =SRC_URI= as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
SRC_URI = "\
file://a.patch \
file://b.patch \
file://c.patch \
"
#+END_SRC

=a.patch=, =b.patch=, =c.patch=, are the local files in yocto, 

when doing =unpack=, it will copy from yocto to the =${B}=.



when building the =mscsend= recipe,
we can use:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
bitbake -c package mscsend
#+END_SRC

** problem when building

when building using below command,

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
bitbake mscsend
#+END_SRC


can not find =mscsend= executable file in ${D}, or anywhere, not sure why
