  Abstract                 = {We present Asirra, a CAPTCHA that asks users to identify cats out of a set of 12 photographs of both cats and dogs. Asirra is easy for users; user studies indicate it can be solved by humans 99.6% of the time in under 30 seconds. Barring a major advance in machine vision, we expect computers will have no better than a 1/54,000 chance of solving it. Asirraâ€™s image database is provided by a novel, mutually beneficial partnership with Petfinder.com. In exchange for the use of their three million images, we display an "adopt me" link beneath each one, promoting Petfinderâ€™s primary mission of finding homes for homeless animals. We describe the design of Asirra, discuss threats to its security, and report early deployment experiences. We also describe two novel algorithms for amplifying the skill gap between humans and computers that can be used on many existing CAPTCHAs.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, DNNs have achieved great improvement for acoustic modeling in speech recognition tasks. However, it is difficult to train the models well when the depth grows. One main reason is that when training DNNs with traditional sigmoid units, the derivatives damp sharply while back-propagating between layers, which restrict the depth of model especially with insufficient training data. To deal with this problem, some unbounded activation functions have been proposed to preserve sufficient gradients, including ReLU and softplus. Compared with ReLU, the smoothing and nonzero properties of the in gradient makes softplus-based DNNs perform better in both stabilization and performance. However, softplus-based DNNs have been rarely exploited for the phoneme recognition task. In this paper, we explore the use of softplus units for DNNs in acoustic modeling for context-independent phoneme recognition tasks. The revised RBM pre-training and dropout strategy are also applied to improve the performance of softplus units. Experiments show that, the DNNs with softplus units get significantly performance improvement and uses less epochs to get convergence compared to the DNNs trained with standard sigmoid units and ReLUs.},
