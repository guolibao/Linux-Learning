## Abstract - English
This paper explains the DYCOS-Algorithm as it was introduced in by Aggarwal and
Li in 2011. It operates on graphs whichs nodes are partially labeled and
automatically adds missing labels to nodes. To do so, the DYCOS algorithm makes
use of the structure of the graph as well as content which is assigned to the
node. Aggarwal and Li measured in an experimental analysis that DYCOS adds
the missing labels to a Graph with 19396 nodes of which 14814 are labeled and
another Graph with 806635 nodes of which 18999 are labeld on one core of an
Intel Xeon 2.5 GHz CPU with 32 G RAM within less than a minute.
Additionally, extensions of the DYCOS algorithm are proposed.
