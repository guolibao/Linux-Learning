\section*{Obtaining the data}
The data can be found at \dbDownloadURL. It is a \verb+tar.gz+ file of
\SI{\dbSizeMB}{\mega\byte}. The file can be verified with the MD5sum

\texttt{\dbMDfivesum}

The data is published under the ODbL~license. If you use
the \dbName~dataset, please cite this paper.

The \verb+tar.gz+ archive contains all data as png images and CSV files with
labels. The CSV files have the
columns \verb+path,symbol_id,latex,user_id+ with a header row. The \verb+path+ is the
relative path to a training example to the CSV file, e.g. \verb+../hasy-data/v2-00000.png+. The
\verb+symbol_id+ is an internal numeric identifier for the symbol class. The
website \href{http://write-math.com/symbol/?id=968}{write-math.com/symbol/?id=[symbol\_id]}
gives information related to the symbol. The column \verb+latex+ contains the
\LaTeX{} command associated with the class.
