## Structure

1. Every example has to be in its own folder. The name of the folder should
   tell the reader what the example shows.
2. Contents of that folder:
    1. Every example has to have a `Makefile` which contains all the commands
       necessary to compile the document.
    2. The main TeX file should have the same name as the folder.
    3. Every example has to have a `README.md`. For images / graphic examples,
       this should include the rendered image. For documents, there should be
       some example text explaining what it is about.
3. Use spaces for indenting.
4. Don't have trailing spaces.
