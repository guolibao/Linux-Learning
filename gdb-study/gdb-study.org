* run gdb with argument
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gdb --args executablename arg1 arg2 arg3
#+END_SRC

If you want it to run automatically, 
place some commands in a file (e.g. 'run') 
and give it as argument: -x /tmp/cmds. 
Optionally you can run with -batch mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gdb -batch -x /tmp/cmds --args executablename arg1 arg2 arg3
#+END_SRC
