#+title: USB sniffing

Here are a few tutorials on USB sniffing on Linux, to get you started.

- Official Wireshark wiki for USB monitoring
- biot.com/blog/usb-sniffing-on-linux (InternetArchive)
- tjworld.net/wiki/Linux/Ubuntu/USBmonitoring

Essentially you use the =usbmon= Linux kernel module to capture
 the USB-packets and =Wireshark= as a front-end to display and analyse the
 captured USB stream.
